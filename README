initial goal:
    make a calculator for the iphone

new goal:
    make a simple HTML5 app
    allow people to add images
    drag, drop and zoom
    have a library of starting images
    have a shelf that stays attached to the viewport
    make it global and networked
    broadcast drops, not drags

TODO:
autoscale/crop images to fit the square box size
remove border if there is an image
Panning
    - move small boxes, pan window when finger on a larger box.
    - basically think of the window as a box, and panning as a force
    - acting between the touched box and the window?

The tapcode project thus far:
I have boxes which can be dragged.
The viewport can be zoomed.
Boxes get placed inside other boxes and update their absolute size
so that their relative size is the same.
Boxes determine their display based on the contents of boxes they contain.


Other Ideas:
 - boxes all output numbers
 - create a box for displaying numbers
 - output text, stdin, stdout, UNIX style.
